Meeting 1 Notes:

We brainstormed to think of an idea. Ideas considered included:
    - Music visualizer using Spotify
    - Weather capture
    - Various web-based games

We ended up settling on a web-based, multiplayer song lyric guessing game.

Then, we created the three required repositories and worked on the milestone, commited it, and adjourned the meeting.
